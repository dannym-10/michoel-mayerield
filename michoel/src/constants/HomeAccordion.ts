    description:
      "The first session is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss what's brought you to counselling, what you'd like to achieve, and I'll explain how the process works. There's no pressure to share more than you're comfortable with.",

    title: "How long does therapy usually last?",
    description:
      "The length of therapy varies from person to person. Some people find that a few sessions are enough, while others benefit from longer-term support. We'll regularly review your progress together and decide what works best for you.",

    title: "Is everything I say confidential?",
    description:
      "Yes, confidentiality is a cornerstone of our work together. Everything discussed in sessions is kept strictly confidential. The only exceptions are if there is a risk of serious harm to you or someone else, which I would discuss with you first wherever possible.",

    title: "Do you work with parents and families?",
    description:
      "Absolutely. I understand that when a young person is struggling, it affects the whole family. I collaborate with families and actively involve parents and caregivers. Parents and carers are welcome to join the first session if this would be helpful.",

    title: "Can sessions be online?",
